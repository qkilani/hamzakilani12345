    <h1>Alternative Exercises to Cable Tricep Pushdowns</h1>
    <p>If you're looking for an alternative to <strong>Cable Tricep Pushdowns</strong>, here are some effective exercises to target the triceps:</p>

    <h2>1. Tricep Dips (Bench or Machine Dips)</h2>
    <p>If you have access to a dip machine, it's an excellent alternative. Otherwise, you can perform <strong>bench dips</strong> by placing your hands on a bench and your feet on the floor (or elevated for added difficulty).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 8-12 reps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Overhead Tricep Extension (Dumbbell or Cable)</h2>
    <p>Using either a dumbbell or a cable machine, this exercise targets the long head of the triceps and allows for a deep stretch at the bottom.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 10-12 reps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Close-Grip Push-Ups</h2>
    <p>A great bodyweight alternative that really targets the triceps. Keep your hands close together (under your shoulders) to focus more on the triceps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 10-15 reps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Skull Crushers (Lying Tricep Extensions)</h2>
    <p>This can be done with an EZ bar, dumbbells, or a straight barbell. It’s excellent for hitting all three heads of the triceps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 8-10 reps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Tricep Kickbacks (Dumbbell or Cable)</h2>
    <p>This movement can be done with dumbbells or a cable machine, and it’s a great isolation exercise for the triceps, particularly the long head.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 12-15 reps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Diamond Push-Ups</h2>
    <p>This push-up variation places the hands in a diamond shape beneath the chest, which increases the focus on the triceps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3 sets x 10-20 reps</li>
    </ul>
